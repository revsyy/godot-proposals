**Describe the project you are working on:
A clicker game :)**

**Describe the problem or limitation you are having in your project:
Although I'm not working on a super insan game with a complex same system, it would be nice to have the same things as GDscript**

**Describe the feature / enhancement and how it helps to overcome the problem or limitation:
Things like making a new file, or opening a file and formatting it into a text (open txt), and other file related things plus many others**

**Describe how your proposal will work, with code, pseudocode, mockups, and/or diagrams:
Add more nodes in Visual Scripting that allow the user to have the same functionality as GDscript. Add a node for opening the contents of a file, for example a txt file. Having the ability to open the txt file using the file dialogue would be great. This would add the ability to make something like a text editor with a save, open function. I also would LOVEE to see a node that gives us the ability to create a new file, such as in GDscript like "file.new." Also the ability to add content to that newly created file (also like GDscript.**

**If this enhancement will not be used often, can it be worked around with a few lines of script?:
Well, if it won't be used than you won't need to avoid it with other lines of code.**

**Is there a reason why this should be core and not an add-on in the asset library?:
It would be better for many reasons. Beginners, like myself who just recently started programming with Godot and don't know much coding knowledge and are using Visual Scripting would not want to watch more tutorials of how to install a certain add-on to make these new things possible. I am only suggesting a node "expansion" and so if you don't want to use the newly added nodes than you don't even have to worry about them.**
